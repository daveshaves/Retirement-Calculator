# Retirement-Calculator
## Synopsis
This program calculates how much money you will need to fund a full retirement without taking Social Security payments into account. A few assumptions are made to simplify things. Your current salary is sufficiently high enough for you to live on during retirement, the average annual rate of return on your investments is 7%, and the average annual inflation rate is 3%.  
## Using this Program
It's pretty straight-forward. The program takes in the following parameters: your age, the age you would like to retire, your desired length of retirement, your current income, your current retirement savings, and how much money you put into a retirement savings account every year. It then does a bunch of calculations and outputs how much money you will need to fully fund your retirement, how much money your savings will generate over time, and how much you need to save per year.
## Improvements
I'll be adding new features and tweaking the existing code as I attain more programming skills. I also intend on deriving a new formula that makes it so that your retirement savings will continue to earn interest even after you retire and start drawing down on your savings account. This will provide a more realistic picture. I think I will eventually incorporate the Social Security retirement benefit estimate into this program as well.
