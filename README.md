# Retirement-Calculator
## Synopsis
This program calculates how much money you will need to fund a full retirement without taking Social Security payments into account. A few assumptions are made to simplify things. Your current salary is sufficiently high enough for you to live on during retirement, the average annual rate of return on your investments is 7%, and the average annual inflation rate is 3%.  
## Example
As an example, say I'm 26 years old, want to retire at age 66, would like a 20 year long retirement, currently make $50,000 per year, have $25,000 in savings accounts, and put an additional $5000 per year into retirement savings accounts.
